# Programming-oop-tdd


## Robots todo:

- Fork and Clone this directory.

- Write code that makes the tests pass.

- When we instantiate a new instance of Robot we pass in an argument that represents battery power.  Right now we are not doing anything with this information.  Write new functions and/or modify the functions you have written, with tests, to manipulate the state of the battery power.  

- Send a pull request when finished.
